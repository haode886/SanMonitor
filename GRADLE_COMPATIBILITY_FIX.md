# Fixing Java 21.0.6 and Gradle Compatibility Issue

## Problem
Android Studio is showing an error about incompatible Java 21.0.6 and Gradle 7.0.2, even though your project is configured to use Gradle 9.0-milestone-1.

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Force Gradle Sync with Configured Version

1. In Android Studio, go to **File > Sync Project with Gradle Files**
2. If that doesn't work, try **File > Invalidate Caches / Restart... > Invalidate and Restart**

### Step 2: Configure the Correct JDK Version

1. In Android Studio, go to **File > Project Structure...**
2. Under **SDK Location**, check the **JDK location**
3. If it's using Java 21, change it to a compatible JDK version (Java 11 or 17 are recommended)
   - You can download a compatible JDK from the **Download JDK** button

### Step 3: Verify Gradle Wrapper Configuration

Your `gradle-wrapper.properties` is already correctly configured to use Gradle 9.0-milestone-1, but let's ensure it's working:

1. Open a terminal in Android Studio (**View > Tool Windows > Terminal**)
2. Run the following command:
   
   ```bash
   # Windows
   gradlew --version
   
   # Mac/Linux
   ./gradlew --version
   ```
   
3. This should show Gradle 9.0-milestone-1 and a compatible JVM version

### Step 4: Update Gradle Plugin Versions (Optional)

1. Open `app/build.gradle.kts` and ensure you're using up-to-date plugin versions
2. Check `gradle/libs.versions.toml` for plugin version definitions

### Step 5: Clean and Rebuild

1. Go to **Build > Clean Project**
2. Then go to **Build > Rebuild Project**

## Additional Notes

- Gradle 9.0-milestone-1 should be compatible with Java 21, but sometimes Android Studio needs explicit configuration
- If you continue to have issues, you could try downgrading to Gradle 8.5 which is also compatible with Java 21
- Make sure your Android Studio is updated to the latest version
